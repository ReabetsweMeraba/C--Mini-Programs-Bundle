# C++ Mini Programs Bundle

This project is a collection of beginner-friendly C++ programs designed to solve small, real-world problems. Each file demonstrates fundamental concepts such as conditional statements, functions, arrays, arithmetic operations, and user interaction ‚Äî ideal for early computer science learners or practice projects.

---

## üßæ About  
This project groups several standalone C++ programs written for school assignments. It includes basic logic-based tasks like account number validation, leap year detection, array filtering, and simple arithmetic processing. These mini-programs demonstrate foundational programming concepts using clean, functional code.

---

## üìù Programs Included

### ‚úÖ Q1 - Validate Account Number (`ValidateAccountNumber.cpp`)
Validates a user-provided account number using a simple modulo logic. It checks if the last digit is equal to the account number divided by 7.

**Key Concepts**: Arithmetic operations, conditionals.

---

### ‚úÖ Q2 - Farm Animal Leg Counter (`Farmer.cpp`)
Calculates the total number of legs from three types of animals:
- Chickens: 2 legs each
- Cows: 4 legs each
- Sanzuwus (fictional creature): 3 legs each

**Key Concepts**: Multiplication, function return values.

---

### ‚úÖ Q3 - Leap Year Checker (`LeapYear.cpp`)
Asks the user for a year and checks if it's a leap year (divisible by 4) or not.

**Key Concepts**: Modulo logic, user input, simple branching.

---

### ‚úÖ Q4 - Filter Top Students (`Q4_FilterTopStudents.cpp`)
- Prompts the user to enter the number of students.
- Accepts test scores into an array.
- Filters and displays scores above a specified threshold.
- Counts and displays how many students meet the filter condition.

**Key Concepts**: Arrays, conditionals, counting, input validation.

---

### ‚úÖ Extra - Square Root of Pi (`Pi.cpp`)
A small snippet that prints the square root of œÄ (pi) using the `sqrt` function.

**Key Concepts**: Math functions, constants, output formatting.

## üí° How to Run

Make sure you have `g++` installed, then compile and run each file individually:

```bash
g++ Q1_ValidateAccountNumber.cpp -o validate
./validate

g++ Q2_FarmAnimalLegCounter.cpp -o farm
./farm

g++ Q3_LeapYearChecker.cpp -o leap
./leap

g++ Q4_FilterTopStudents.cpp -o filter
./filter

g++ Extra_SqrtOfPi.cpp -o sqrtpi
./sqrtpi
